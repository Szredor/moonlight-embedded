2. Wait some time after a logout and then shutdown domains if its still necesary

6. Config files for client <---
7. Nvidia Gamestream configuration on client <-----

KNOWN BUGS

1.When you try to pair client with guest windows machine and it hasn't been paired earlier it will time out.
SOLUTION - Modify moonlight embedded to send a signal to client when the code is ready to read. Now it waits when moonlight embedded ends, but it wait for signal from windows guest.
