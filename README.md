# Moonlight Multisession

Moonlight Multisession create a remote gaming server and provide linux
client software to play (greatly using https://github.com/irtimmer/moonlight-embedded).

# WARNING ! WORK IN PROGRESS
It works mostly(or not), but if you want to configure it by yourself,
you really should deeply read wiki with linked sources.

# Server, client and slave

* Server software manage VMs and handle clients requests.
On server has to be some preconfigured virtual machines (details [here](https://github.com/Szredor/moonlight-multissesion/wiki))
* Client can connect you with VM on server and stream gameplay from it.
* Slave is used on gaming virtual machines, checking status and pairing GFE if neccessary.

# Configuration isn't easy
I would try to put a lot of sources on [wiki pages](https://github.com/Szredor/moonlight-multissesion/wiki)  which should help.
